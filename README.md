haiku2mqtt is a Node.js application that links SenseME-enabled devices by [Haiku](http://www.haikuhome.com/) to an MQTT broker. It is designed to be used to integrate these devices into a home automation system.

## Getting Started

haiku2mqtt is distributed through NPM:

```sh
npm install -g haiku2mqtt
```

Running it is likewise easy:

```sh
haiku2mqtt                      # if your MQTT broker is running on the same system
haiku2mqtt -b mqtt://<hostname> # if your broker is running elsewhere
haiku2mqtt --help               # to see the full usage documentation
```

## Topics and Payloads

This app is intended to conform to the [mqtt-smarthome](http://www.github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome/) architecture.  The topics used by the app are generally of the form:

| Topic Template                   | Purpose                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `haiku:<id>/status/path/to/prop` | New values will be published here as the device reports them                     |
| `haiku:<id>/set/path/to/prop`    | New values published to these topics will be propagated to the device.           |
| `haiku:<id>/get/path/to/prop`    | Publishing anything to these topics will request updated values from the device. |
